# College-Recomendation-system

## Overview
This project implements a college recommendation system that leverages machine learning algorithms to generate an eligible, tiered list of universities for students based on their academic scores. The system employs a combination of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-means clustering, and K-NN classification to deliver recommendations.

## Description
The goal of this project is to help students identify colleges where they have a high chance of admission based on their academic performance. The system processes input data (e.g., academic scores) and, through a series of ML algorithms, outputs a ranked (tiered) list of recommended universities.

### Key Features
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP):** Used for predictive modeling and feature extraction.
- **K-means Clustering:** Groups universities into tiers based on various metrics.
- **K-NN Classification:** Classifies and recommends the best-fit universities for a given student profile.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing MLP, K-means, and K-NN algorithms.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
